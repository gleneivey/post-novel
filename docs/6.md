## Chapter 4

Trace woke on eir side, Ricar spooned against eir back, eir arm across
Ruth's belly in front of eir.  E wondered which side Jom had ended
up on.  Then E wondered if em'd ever wonder that again--if this would
really be em last morning with them, or if they'd all be back home
together tonight talking about whatever had happened.

The alarm hadn't gone off yet.  From the sunshine coming in there was
an hour, maybe hour and a half, before it would.  They'd agreed
yesterday to sleep late, that they believed the consensus that
whatever was going to happen, it would be around the same time that
the Invitation had come, and there was nothing to be gained by trying
to be among the first to be in the amphitheater.

E scooted out of the covers until E was sitting up on the pillow.
Trying not to wake anyone, E stood up in the half-meter of bed between
the pillows and the headboard.  Jom was on the other side of Ricar, so
E stepped cautiously around Ruth's head and down.  The cats asleep at
the dressing table, one in each of the two chairs.  E envied that they
didn't understand that a big change in their routine might happen
tonight.

Trace walked nude to the band of windows that filled most of the
outside wall, pulled over a foot stool, and sat down.  Eir arms on the
window ledge, E rested eir chin on the back of eir hands and tried to
steady emself.  As soon as E'd gotten out of bed, the tension in eir
stomach had solidified into a knot.  It felt like it just kept getting
heavier, pulling down on everything inside eir.

E heard a rustling behind eir, then the pad of feet across the
bamboo.  When E felt Ricar's hand on eir shoulder, there was a wave of
relief and E turned eir head into eir'a forearm.  "I couldn't make
myself go there without youse, and the only reason I'm going is for
the chance to leave.  Why am I like this?  Why didn't I do something
to back out instead of packing?"

"Because you want to go more than you want to stay, even if you can't
explain what you really want to yourself.  And I want that for you.
I'm grateful being with us makes it easier for you to try."  E leaned
eir head down into eir'a hair, feeling the soft springiness envelope
his face.  "And I'll miss you terribly if you go, but it won't hurt as
much as watching you live with regret."  E lifed eir head, shook eir'a
shoulder gently.  "Besides, you'll probably be back next week."

Ricar shifted to stand directly behind Trace, eir thighs pressed
against eir'a back, eir'a hair tickling his dick, and put a hand on
each of eir'a shoulders.  Trace sighed, and they stayed like that
until the others woke.

*****

Maj and eir family arrived around thirteen o'clock.  They'd brought a
black-bean goulash for lunch.

Trace and eir partners had been settled in the living room, idly
playing Mahjong and making small talk.  Nobody brought up anything
that might sound like a plan or mentioned what they might do tomorrow.
They hadn't much dressed before coming down stairs: Trace was in a
robe, Ruth and Jom both in only old skirts, and Ricar in a pair of old
gi pants em'd rescued from Trace.  There wasn't the energy to have
breakfast, either.  They had cups of tea, and there was a half-eaten
plat of toasted tofu biscuits on the table next to them.

In contrast, Maj and Michael had dressed up, and done their best to
get Hal and Lydon into things that were dressy but they could stay in
all day.  Michael wore a hemp twill suit, navy blue, and a white
cotton shirt, with matching royal blue suspenders, collar, and
sporran.  E had a pea coat over eir arm and was holding a navy knit
cap.

Ruth had stood when they'd entered, followed by Jom and Ricar.  As
soon as they were inside, the kids broke from their parents, took a
couple of steps in looking around, and then whirled to race up
stairs.  Ricar ran up after them, calling "Oh ho ho, what are you two
up to?"

"Can I get you tea or something?" Jom asked.

"That would be very nice, yes please," said Michael.

"Thank you, yes," said Maj.  E carried the goulash across the room and
set it on the dining table, then walked back toward the door, taking
off eir cream-color canvas duster to hang up.  E was in a charcoal
suit and collarless cream blouse.  Eir choker, suspenders, and sporran
matched Michael's, but E wore eir suspenders crossed between eir
breasts.

Michael took eir coat and hung it next to eirs'a.  They both walked
over to the coffee table, Maj sitting in the arm chair next to Trace,
Michael going to the far end of the couch next to where Ruth sat back
down.  Maj reached over to take Trace's hand, "How are you doing?"

Trace gave a wan smile, made a click-click sound as E tried to find an
answer.  "I'm not sure.  It's hard to feel that it's real, that I
might actually be leaving, even though I know that there are only a
couple of hundred of us that still might be selected.  I think I want
the uncertainty to be over, more than I want to go or to stay."  Maj
squeezed eir hand, dropping eir'a gaze.

The kids came back down the stairs, Ricar walking behind.  Hal was
carrying one of the cats over eir shoulder, cooing to eir'a and
scratching eirs'a head.  Lydon was carrying eir'e new toy, that E'e'd
brought with em'e:  a stuffed version of the Invitation, big as eir'e
head.  It had a smiling face stitched into the round top, and its
eight soft legs swayed back and forth as E'e walked.

Lydon flew eir toy from the bottom of the stairs over until it was
above the coffee table, carefully rotated it in place so the legs
faced down, then landed it between the game and the biscuits, all the
while making "whooshing" sounds.  Once it was down, he knelt between
Maj and Trace, who reached over to stroke the back of eir head.

Hal sat cross-legged in the armchair at the end of the table, settled
the cat into eir lap, and asked "when do we eat?"

*****

They arrived at the amphitheater earlier than they'd planned.  After
they'd finished eating, conversation died out, and the apartment
started to feel claustrophobic.  Even the kids became subdued, and
then restless, under the hospital-waiting-room feeling that had come
on.

It was overcast and cold--it would start snowing regularly any day.
The trip to amphitheater was busy, but not overwhelmingly so.  When
they reached the bridge, there was just a trickle of people going
over, and nobody coming back.  Most of the people were in tight groups
like theirs.  Occasionally Trace could tell which person in a group
might be selected, they were carrying some luggage or everyone else in
the group was focused on them.  There was one person that passed them,
with a purposeful stride and large backpack.

Trace's own two-meter duffel sat heavily against eir back, its handles
looped over eir left shoulder.  And knowing that it marked her in
other people's sight made it feel a little heavier.

They walked to one of the archways in the wall between the plaza and
the seating, and peered through.  The front half of the amphitheater
seemed to have been reserved for those who might be selected and the
people who came with them, and was about two-thirds full.  The rest of
the amphitheater was completely packed with spectators.  From the
conversations they overheard as they walked toward the front, it
seemed like most of the spectators who'd gotten a seat had been in
line before dawn.  Trace wondered how many of them had wanted to be
selected themselves?  Whether they'd been more disappointed or
relieved when their Selector had gone dark?  What feeling had brought
them here to see what would happen to the ones taking their place?

Trace picked a row near the back of the open section, paused while her
family swirled around, trying to decide on a seating order, and then
walked in.  They'd ended with Maj and Michael on the inside, a kid on
each lap.  Ricar and Jom were next to em, and Ruth was on the
outside.  E stood the duffel on end between eir and the next bench,
and sat down to wait.
