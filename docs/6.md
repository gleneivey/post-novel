## Chapter 4

Trace woke on eir side, Ricar spooned against eir back, eir arm across
Ruth's belly in front of eir.  E wondered which side Jom had ended
up on.  Then E wondered if em'd ever wonder that again--if this would
really be em last morning with them, or if they'd all be back home
together tonight talking about whatever had happened.

The alarm hadn't gone off yet.  From the sunshine coming in there was
an hour, maybe hour and a half, before it would.  They'd agreed
yesterday to sleep late, that they believed the consensus that
whatever was going to happen, it would be around the same time that
the Invitation had come, and there was nothing to be gained by trying
to be among the first to be in the amphitheater.

E scooted out of the covers until E was sitting up on the pillow.
Trying not to wake anyone, E stood up in the half-meter of bed between
the pillows and the headboard.  Jom was on the other side of Ricar, so
E stepped cautiously around Ruth's head and down.  The cats asleep at
the dressing table, one in each of the two chairs.  E envied that they
didn't understand that a big change in their routine might happen
tonight.

Trace walked nude to the band of windows that filled most of the
outside wall, pulled over a foot stool, and sat down.  Eir arms on the
window ledge, E rested eir chin on the back of eir hands and tried to
steady emself.  As soon as E'd gotten out of bed, the tension in eir
stomach had solidified into a knot.  It felt like it just kept getting
heavier, pulling down on everything inside eir.

E heard a rustling behind eir, then the pad of feet across the
bamboo.  When E felt Ricar's hand on eir shoulder, there was a wave of
relief and E turned eir head into eir'a forearm.  "I couldn't make
myself go there without youse, and the only reason I'm going is for
the chance to leave.  Why am I like this?  Why didn't I do something
to back out instead of packing?"

"Because you want to go more than you want to stay, even if you can't
explain what you really want to yourself.  And I want that for you.
I'm grateful being with us makes it easier for you to try."  E leaned
eir head down into eir'a hair, feeling the soft springiness envelope
his face.  "And I'll miss you terribly if you go, but it won't hurt as
much as watching you live with regret."  E lifed eir head, shook eir'a
shoulder gently.  "Besides, you'll probably be back next week."

Ricar shifted to stand directly behind Trace, eir thighs pressed
against eir'a back, eir'a hair tickling his dick, and put a hand on
each of eir'a shoulders.  Trace sighed, and they stayed like that
until the others woke.

*****

Maj and eir family arrived around thirteen o'clock.  They'd brought a
black-bean goulash for lunch.

Trace and eir partners had been settled in the living room, idly
playing Mahjong and making small talk.  Nobody brought up anything
that might sound like a plan or mentioned what they might do tomorrow.
They hadn't much dressed before coming down stairs: Trace was in a
robe, Ruth and Jom both in only old skirts, and Ricar in a pair of old
gi pants em'd rescued from Trace.  There wasn't the energy to have
breakfast, either.  They had cups of tea, and there was a half-eaten
plat of toasted tofu biscuits on the table next to them.

In contrast, Maj and Michael had dressed up, and done their best to
get Hal and Lydon into things that were dressy but they could stay in
all day.  Michael wore a hemp twill suit, navy blue, and a white
cotton shirt, with matching royal blue suspenders, collar, and
sporran.  E had a pea coat over eir arm and was holding a navy knit
cap.

Ruth had stood when they'd entered, followed by Jom and Ricar.  As
soon as they were inside, the kids broke from their parents, took a
couple of steps in looking around, and then whirled to race up stairs.
Ricar ran up after them, calling "Oh ho ho, what are youse two up to?"

"Can I get youse tea or something?" Jom asked.

"That would be very nice, yes please," said Michael.

"Thank you, yes," said Maj.  E carried the goulash across the room and
set it on the dining table, then walked back toward the door, taking
off eir cream-color canvas duster to hang up.  E was in a charcoal
suit and collarless cream blouse.  Eir choker, suspenders, and sporran
matched Michael's, but E wore eir suspenders crossed between eir
breasts.

Michael took eir coat and hung it next to eirs'a.  They both walked
over to the coffee table, Maj sitting in the arm chair next to Trace,
Michael going to the far end of the couch next to where Ruth sat back
down.  Maj reached over to take Trace's hand, "How are you doing?"

Trace gave a wan smile, made a click-click sound as E tried to find an
answer.  "I'm not sure.  It's hard to feel that it's real, that I
might actually be leaving, even though I know that there are only a
couple of hundred of us that still might be selected.  I think I want
the uncertainty to be over, more than I want to go or to stay."  Maj
squeezed eir hand, dropping eir'a gaze.

The kids came back down the stairs, Ricar walking behind.  Hal was
carrying one of the cats over eir shoulder, cooing to eir'a and
scratching eirs'a head.  Lydon was carrying eir'e new toy, that E'e'd
brought with em'e:  a stuffed version of the Invitation, big as eir'e
head.  It had a smiling face stitched into the round top, and its
eight soft legs swayed back and forth as E'e walked.

Lydon flew eir toy from the bottom of the stairs over until it was
above the coffee table, carefully rotated it in place so the legs
faced down, then landed it between the game and the biscuits, all the
while making "whooshing" sounds.  Once it was down, he knelt between
Maj and Trace, who reached over to stroke the back of eir head.

Hal sat cross-legged in the armchair at the end of the table, settled
the cat into eir lap, and asked "when do we eat?"

*****

They arrived at the amphitheater earlier than they'd planned.  After
they'd finished eating, conversation died out, and the apartment
started to feel claustrophobic.  Even the kids became subdued, and
then restless, under the hospital-waiting-room feeling that had come
on.

It was overcast and cold--it would start snowing regularly any day.
The trip to amphitheater was busy, but not overwhelmingly so.  When
they reached the bridge, there was just a trickle of people going
over, and nobody coming back.  Most of the people were in tight groups
like theirs.  Occasionally Trace could tell which person in a group
might be selected, they were carrying some luggage or everyone else in
the group was focused on them.  There was one person that passed them,
with a purposeful stride and large backpack.

Trace's own two-meter duffel sat heavily against eir back, its handles
looped over eir left shoulder.  And knowing that it marked her in
other people's sight made it feel a little heavier.

They walked to one of the archways in the wall between the plaza and
the seating, and peered through.  The front half of the amphitheater
seemed to have been reserved for those who might be selected and the
people who came with them, and was about two-thirds full.  The rest of
the amphitheater was completely packed with spectators.  From the
conversations they overheard as they walked toward the front, it
seemed like most of the spectators who'd gotten a seat had been in
line before dawn.  Trace wondered how many of them had wanted to be
selected themselves?  Whether they'd been more disappointed or
relieved when their Selector had gone dark?  What feeling had brought
them here to see what would happen to the ones taking their place?

Trace picked a row near the back of the open section, paused while her
family swirled around, trying to decide on a seating order, and then
walked in.  They'd ended with Maj and Michael on the inside, a kid on
each lap.  Ricar and Jom were next to em, and Ruth was on the outside.
E stood the duffel on end against the back of the bench in front of em
and sat down to wait.

*****

The hours before dark passed by Trace as if E were dreaming, leaving
little but loose impressions.  Eir family laughing and talking, the
kids playing and reading.  Dark, fearful thoughts E wouldn't have said
aloud--what if it weren't the Saviors?  What if they no longer were, or
never had been, looking out for humans?  What if everyone's best
guesses about where and when were wrong?  The Invitation had been
counting down the days, the number engraved in its skin changing
(how?) every day at the same time it landed.  So everyone was
expecting them to arrive when the count reached zero, tonight.  And
the Invitation had come here, a space clearly created by the Saviors
before people started building the city with the Border.  And it
hadn't landed in the circle of the stage itself, but in the little
flat circle between the stage and the front row.  Leaving the stage
empty for the Saviors to land?

The shows planned in the amphitheater after the annual pageant had
been postponed, and the free-standing frame that had bridged over the
stage, holding lights and vertically-stored scenery, had been removed.
Now there were street lights that had been moved in temporarily,
standing in the aisles and along the outside of the stage.

There had been performers on stage all day.  Singers, acrobats,
jugglers, the city symphony orchestra.  About an hour before dark,
Trace's sword guild gave an exhibition, including Tate and Soowash
dueling with live blades.  If E hadn't been in the seats, it would
have been em and Tate.  And E'd have won.

It was full dark, the clouds were thick, but Primary was just past
full and the glow was visible even with the street lighting.  Trace
noticed that E could see eir breath.  Everyone else had coats, some
gloves, and the kids had gotten hot cocoa from a cart that was
circulating through the aisles.  Trace was wearing eir gi and boots,
but had thermal weave shirt and tights underneath.  It was the nice
gi, pure white with yellow piping around the seems, that Jom and Ricar
had had made for em birthday three years ago.

E wondered, if E were actually selected, and if it turned out they
got to come back again, maybe E would find gifts to bring back.  E was
still in the middle of the warmth of that thought when someone yelled.

"What's that?"

E was confused for a moment, not being able to tell where the yell had
come from.  Then lots of people were yelling, and even more pointing
into the sky to the west.  There was a bright white spot behind the
clouds, moving rapidly toward zenith.  The sound came a few moments
later--a deep, steady roar, that was getting louder and lower as the
spot moved closer.  When it was almost straight overhead, it winked
out.  There were gasps and a couple of cries.  Moments later, the roar
cut off as well and was replaced by a softer, vibrating whine.
Everyone was staring straight up, trying to see the source.

It took minutes, several very long-feeling minutes, while the new
noise also dropped in pitch as it got louder, until a tiny reflected
glint could be seen against the dark clouds.  A roar rippled through
the crowd.  It continued to descend, the noise growing, until it
seemed to suddenly be right above them--an actual shape instead of
just a featureless shiny object.  From underneath it was a round solid
surface, with long legs around the circumference.  It was loud enough
a few people plugged their ears, but most were too focused.  It seemed
to slow to almost a halt in midair, just as it was low enough to make
out the fact that it was a cylinder with a flat bottom, the legs maybe
a full seven meters.  Then the noise stopped and it seemed to fall toward
the stage.  People gasped, the ends of the legs struck the stage with
a metal-on-stone scrape, and then it started to slow its descent.  The
legs retracted into the ship as it slowed, until it came to rest with
its bottom flat on the stage, stopping at the same instant the last of
the legs disappeared into its body.

And there was silence.  Someone somewhere started to clap, but nobody
joined and it died out.

The ship was a cylinder, about eight meters tall and five in diameter,
a uniform dull metallic grey.  The top was a very shallow dome, adding
less than a meter to its total height.  Sticking out from the ship
around the upper edge were a dozen rings a little over a meter across,
each with what looked like a fan blade idly turning within.  There
were no windows in the body of the ship.  There were a number of dark
grey outlines around its base, each three meters high and two meters
wide, with about a meter space between each.

It had been almost long enough for people to start wondering why
nothing more had happened when the rings began to rotate up.  Jom gave
a startled jump at eir side.  In a few seconds the rings had gone from
horizontal to past vertical, so their edges were touching and they
formed the outline of a truncated cone at the top of the ship.

After another pause that Trace forgot to breathe during, the ship's
surface inside the two outlines nearest the front of the stage
quivered.  The areas were hatches, with the doors moving out and then
up, so that they came to rest against the outside directly
above the opening.  There was clearly an open area inside the hatches,
but it was too dark relative to the brightly-lit stage to see any
details.

And then it finally happened, _they_ started to come out.  They
stepped out and the few centimeters down to the stage one at a time,
alternating between the two hatches.  The Saviors--Trace's fists were
literally clenched with the hope that they really were--looked mostly
like people.  They were taller than average for the people in the
city, but not unreasonably so.  They all had straight hair, but
different lengths and colors, and one completely bald.  All of them
had a thin silver strip, maybe two centimeters wide, along (in?) their
skin, running from behind their left ear, down the neck and along the
top of the shoulder, until it turned above the ball of the shoulder
and ran down into the arm pit.

They had uniformly thin builds.  There was quite a bit of variation in
their clothing, though none seemed dressed for the cold.  There were
six of them now, outside the ship, and they weren't moving to make
room for more.

The one farthest left, who'd gotten out first, wore an armless tunic
in pale green and light boots that came to mid-calf.  E was dark
skinned, though not as dark as Trace emself'a, and had three circular
pink patches on eir upper arms.  Eir hair was shoulder length, parted
in the middle, black with streaks of white.

The Savior that had come out last walked forward from the line they'd
formed as they debarked and to the edge of the stage.  E was wearing
something like braccae down to the knees, and what looked like a suit
vest with bronze weaving for a closure down the front as a top.  Both
were a light saffron.  They were all wearing boots of basically the
same cut as the first; eirs were blood red with black piping.  Eir
hair was fair and cut short, eir skin a rose-toned copper.  And,
partially obscured by the left shoulder strap of eir top, there seemed
to be a light grey disk set into the front of eir shoulder, five or
six centimeters across.

One of the others was wearing a top that exposed their shoulders and
breasts, it was a simple brown fabric strip, ten centimeters wide,
running from a flat circular collar the same width until it
disappeared into the waist band of eir dark brown and cream patterned
pants.  E had the grey disk in the shoulder, too.

Then, the one at the front of the stage began to speak.  "We are
returned to youse, having pledged.  Pleasing unto, that youse have not
wasted yourse recovery or bounty of this, the city of Haran."  As E
talked, there was a dark shimmering around the ends of eir hair, and
Trace saw brown chevron-shapes bloom on the outside of eir calves and
forearms.

The second-to-last Savior to debark started walking toward the front
of the stage.  E was wearing a long skirt, off-white and looking as
thin as linen.  Eir top was light grey, with cap sleeves and a v-neck
that plunged to a gather just above the navel.  Looking closely, Trace
could see the edge of another grey disk on the left side, just above
eir cleavage.  At first Trace thought eir skin was white and E had
many ochre tattoos, but as E walked, Trace could see the boundaries
shifting between dark and light, even a shock of brown spreading into
the honey-blond hair down to the middle of eir back.

E reached the front of the stage, and spoke.
