## Chapter 5

Jacob stepped through the hatch and into the ship.  E could feel the
threshold, as if an invisible inner door had parted just at the edges
of eir body.  E passed through, a sensation sweeping across em, part
cold, as if a metal rolling pin were being passed over eir bare skin
from front to back, and part oddly uncomfortable, like biting into a
too-hot pepper, if somehow eir skin was able to taste.

E also had a clenching in eir stomach, like being in an elevator that
was starting to sink and ascend simultaneously.  Once E was two full
steps inside, E paused, literally shaking eir head to clear it, and
then looked around.  The single circular room looked like it occupied
the entire bottom of the ship.  Bright light cam in the hatch behind
em, and the other one to eir right that the sword-performer now stood
in front of, bent over with eir'a hands on eir'a knees.

It was dim inside.  Jacob might have described it as mood lighting,
except it had a cool, grey tone instead of warm.  The floor, ceiling,
and circular wall were all glowing with images of the amphitheater and
sky.  The effect was uncanny--as if the outside of the ship were made
from darkened glass, except the images were obviously flat, with no
sense of parallax from the objects outside.  There was a solid black
band, about fifteen centimeters wide, around the floor where the wall
joined it, at the corner between wall and ceiling, and around an
oblong opening in the ceiling about a third of the way around the ship
to their right.  The opening was above what Jacob realized was a
curving staircase from this room into what must be one above it.

E recoiled for a moment at the thought of the stairs--they seemed
incredibly unsafe.  The treads weren't even as deep as the length of
eir foot, and the distance up from each was larger than the treads'
depth.  Each step was barely a centimeter thick, protruding directly
from the wall, with no apparent support.  There was nothing connecting
the steps together vertically, and no railing.  Nothing at all to stop
a small child or animal from falling off or through.

This didn't seem to bother the Saviors though, as the one that the
other person was following reached the bottom of them and started up.
Jacob was startled by how E ascended--seeming to just keep walking
with eir normal stride length, regardless of the number of steps up
each step forward took them.  As E was going up, the Savior Jacob had
followed turned around to face them.  Em'a raised and spread eir'a
arms, in what Jacob took to be a welcoming gesture.  "Comfort-taking,
sit or stand," the Savior said.  E'a was the one with the soprano
voice.  "Three Moments on, leaving Gan.  Should make ease."  And with
that, E'a turned again and mounted the steps.

Jacob turned to the other person, who was standing again.  "So, did
that mean that we should stay down here?  Oh, and hi, I'm Jacob."

E passed eir hand over eir face, turned to em'a, and tried to grin.
Though Jacob could still see the shine of tears in the corners of eir
beautiful, dark eyes.  "Hello Jacob, I'm Trace."

"I'm happy to meet you.  And very happy they didn't invite just one of
us.  I believe I've seen you perform."  E didn't want to mention the
day E filmed em'a practicing under the oaks.  "That was you in the
circus last spring, fighting off all those jugglers' batons?"

Trace's grin became real, dipped toward sheepish.  "Yes, that was my
act.  I'm glad it was memorable.  I think I've seen your work, too.
Are you the one who drew the series of pictures of the city viewed
from the blimp?"

"Yeah, those were mine.  Years ago.  I'm glad you saw them."

"Me too.  And yes," Trace said, shifting the large bag on eir back, "I
think they mean for us to stay down here."  E started across the broad
floor, headed for the opposite wall.

Jacob noticed a dimming behind em.  E turned back and could see the
last two Saviors standing just outside the ship.  E walked in from the
hatch, making room for em'a to enter.  The Savior walked in behind em,
and then sat down cross-legged directly in front of the opening.
After that, and the other Savior had come in and sat on an open-legged
ottoman on the far side of eir'e hatch.  Then, the outer doors started
to swing down and in to close the hatches.  Their inside surface was a
dull grey until they came to rest, when they lit up showing the rest
of the view out.

Trace had reached the far side of the cabin, and put eir duffel bag
down in the area under the steps up.  Then E turned back to survey the
space.  There were a number of chairs of different types around the
room: a second ottoman, a classic wing-back armchair, a very
low-backed love seat, and a couple that looked like dining-table
chairs, except the backs were narrow padded bars.

Jacob walked over to the love seat, set eir backpacks down behind it,
and then wedged his shoulder bags up on edge between them.  E itched
to take out one of the pads E brought and sketch the room around them,
but knew E wasn't comfortable enough to produce good work.  And wanted
to believe E didn't need a distraction badly enough to waste supplies
just as a pacifier.  There was a barely audible hum E couldn't locate
at first, but then noticed that the rings around the top of the ship
were rotating down again.  They were back horizontal, and then the hum
stopped.

The ship leapt into the air.  The floor lit up with an image of the
stage below them as soon as they were off the ground at all.  Then the
blades in the rings blurred and the legs retracted again.  All without
any feeling of motion at all.  Jacob was still standing next to the
love seat, but saw that Trace had reacted by dropping into slight
crouch, arms out for balance.  E wasn't sure E'a was aware of eir'a
pose yet, though, because eir'a eyes were wide and fixed on the image
of the city filling the wall to eir right.  It had been only a few
seconds, but they were already at least three hundred meters up and
accelerating.  The wedge of the amphitheater, still directly below
them, was starting to dwindle.  The bright lights in the theater and
across the bridge contrasted with the darkness around them and the sky
light glinting off the river.

As the amphitheater shrank away from them, the breadth of the city
spread out to the side.  Jacob and Trace were mesmerized.  Even the
two Saviors in the cabin with them were watching the view as they
rose.  Just as they could see the full extent of Haran, its circular
Border, the great dark countryside surrounding it, and the handful of
sparkling peaks behind the city to the south.  Just as they rose above
the highest peak, almost two klicks up, there were suddenly no images
on the walls.  Jacob gasped--E had almost entirely forgotten they were
watching images on walls, rather than reality through windows.  They
were left looking around in the barely-lit cabin, the walls giving off
the very faint glow of a backlit screen showing all black.

It was just a moment later when the walls brightened and Jacob
understood what had happened.  They had been in the clouds!  The
clouds that were now spread out as far as they could see below them.
The sky and stars were crystal clear around them.  Primary was waning
gibbous in the east, all but a sliver above the horizon, and three of
its other moons were also visible.  When they'd first emerged from the
clouds, they looked like wispy hills and mountains above them.  As
they continued to rise, the detail blurred until the cloud layer
looked like a fluffy grey blanket, with a barely visible bright patch
over what must have been the city almost straight down.

Jacob couldn't judge their height at all any more.  Three klicks above
the clouds?  Ten?  A little more than a minute after they'd emerged
from the clouds, a soft hissing was added to the background noise.  At
the same time, black ovals appeared in the ceiling view, stretching
between the bases of each of the fan rings.  The rings then rotated up
again, and then faded out of the image altogether.  The hiss deepened
and got a little louder, until it sounded like a heavy flow of water
from a faucet in another room.

E suddenly felt a wave of vertigo, as if E were suddenly falling over
even though E still felt like E was standing up straight.  Jacob
lurched back, then forward again when E felt like E really was going
to fall.  An instant later the vertigo left em as E realized what was
happening: the ship was gradually tilting over, pointing its top
toward the east, and making it look like the carpet of clouds below
them was rising up to meet eir face.  E closed eir eyes, and was sure
E was standing up straight.  E opened them, and could see the eastern
horizon line a meter up the wall from where it joined the floor and
rising.

E heard a thump, and looked back to eir left where Trace had been
standing.  E'a had a tremendous smile and looked like E'a'd just
landed from a jump.  As E watched, E'a did a standing backflip and
landed with another thump.  Then a standing forward flip.  The ship
had gotten more than half-way over to horizontal relative to the cloud
deck, and Jacob started to feel nauseous.  And hot.

E took off his jacket, revealing a charcoal crossover-front v-neck
shirt with two-centimeter facings of light grey satin and fastened by
a button above eir right hip.  Jacob carefully laid the jacket over
eir backpacks, then even more cautiously settled emself into the love
seat.  E laid back, dangling eir legs over the arm at one end, and
tried to hold very, very still.

*****

It had been about twenty minutes since the Saviors' ship had taken
them off the ground, and Trace kept forgetting to breathe if E didn't
make an effort to remember.  Jacob was lying on the little couch where
he'd been for a while, looking pallid and sweaty.  E'd noticed that
shortly after launch, the two Saviors in the room had turned their
attention from the scenery to the humans.  E pretended not to have.

Trace realized E'd also let her knees lock up while E watched the
world turn below them.  E did some deep knee bends, then took a couple
of steps over to the arm chair, which was a couple more steps away
from the end of the little couch where Jacob's head was.  E rotated
the chair so it faced the wall that now looked "down" onto the planet
below.  Deliberately, E unbuckled and removed eir belt, leaving the
sporran and saber attached.  E buckled it again and hung it over a
corner of the chair back.  Then E removed eir gi top, hung it from the
opposite corner, and sat down in the chair cross-legged.  E was glad
em'd worn the thermals under eir gi.  They had been just warm enough
in the amphitheater, and now the lemon yellow knit was cheering as the
wonder at everything warred in em with a bottomless sense of
loneliness.

E decided it was time to see if enigmatic was the extent of eir hosts
personalities.  E made eye contact with the Savior sitting on the
ottoman.  "Hi, I'm Trace.  What is your name?"

E turned at the waist, upper body facing Trace squarely.  "Hello
Trace.  I label Ahn-suahftah.  Welcome to travel."

"Thank you, Ahn-suahftah.  I am pleased to travel with you.  Where are
we going?"

"When?"

Trace frowned slightly.  "Right now.  Where will we arrive next?  How
long do you expect we will remain in this ship, and where will we be
when we get out?"

"Short time. Proximate transfer within Ahn tor-ship Velensis."

"Right."  Trace blinked.  "And do you know how long we'll be traveling
with youse?"

"No," said Ahn-suahftah.

Well, thought Trace, at least that's better than "forever."  And
"forever" wouldn't be the worst thing if E could spend it with the
view that they had at that moment.

Trace studied the Savior.  E was the only one that they'd seen so far
who was bald, though E did have eyebrows and lashes.  Eir complexion
was olive over all, but as E'd talked, Trace had thought E'a'd seen a
lightening start around the crown of eir head.  Eir shirt was some
kind of pull-over with elbow-length sleeves and the opening at the top
cut wide to expose the tops of eir shoulders.  It and the pants were
skin-tight and clingy, colored pine-needle green with narrow
loam-colored piping around the collar, cuffs, and hem.  The ubiquitous
boots were dark green.

E'd been sitting perfectly straight, but it hadn't appeared forced or
uncomfortable, and since E'd turned to Trace, there'd been no
additional motion or sign that E couldn't sit half-twisted
indefinitely.  Eir hands remained with the palms against eir thighs,
with no hint toward gesturing while E was speaking.

Trace found emself considering the shape of Ahn-suahftah's body
through eir'a clothes.  E hadn't spent a moment's consideration on the
bare breasts of the Savior who'd walked em up to the ship, but now was
closely examining eir'a shape.  Ahn-suahftah had a barrel chest and
small breasts.  Eir'a stomach was perfectly smooth, and before E'a had
twisted, Trace had noticed a dimple where E expected eir'a navel.
Eir'a legs were girthy with thick ankles, but currently relaxed.  And
Trace peered long enough to be sure E'a had a bulge at eir'a groin.

E glanced away.  "How many of youse are there?  Will you be with us
while we are traveling?  What are youse called?  Do you mind us
calling youse Saviors?"

"Our kind are Chaiken, and we are 52 and one tenth millions, Ahn, Ree,
and Thal.  We are six within this raft and twenty-two uns our touring
party."

E took a moment to digest.  There were barely more than half a million
of them in Haran--all the people in the universe.  E had a hard time
imagining a hundred times that many, though E knew from history that
there'd once been unfathomable billions of humans.

There was a rustling behind em, and E craned around to look over the
back of eir chair.  Jacob had rolled over onto eir'a side and was
looking toward em and the Sav--Chaiken.  E'a seemed greatly improved.

Trace turned back to Ahn-suahftah, said "I like your name."
