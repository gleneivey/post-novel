## Chapter 8

Trace's arm settled in eir hand as e'a stepped from the pad onto the
floor next to em.  Jacob was surprised to find E was actually
supporting some of eir'a weight.  E'd meant taking eir'a arm as a
gesture of support and solidarity, but E'a was moving as if injured or
exhausted.  As they followed Sel and the rest toward a low cluster of
chairs, Jacob was also surprised at how touched E felt that Trace was
willing to depend on em&mdash;even just this little bit.

It was a grouping of stools circling a simple round table, with a
single central leg attaching it to the floor.  The arrangement
reminded em of a diner.  There were eight chairs, and the others
settled around the arc closest to where they'd been, so their backs
were toward Hunt, Regina, and the Chaiken.  Jacob led Trace to the far
side.  E sat down facing the other group, with an empty stool between
emself and Sel on eir right.  Jacob sat down immediately eir left.

There was silence for a while.  Jacob thought over what had happened,
whether something different had been expected of them, why any of it
had been allowed.

E also studied who they were with.  It was a marvel that even though
Sel and Japhet's liaison seemed to be identical, E could easily
distinguish them by their carriage and how they related to the others.
Sel had faced toward em and Trace as they'd walked over, and was now
sitting on the front edge of eir'a stool, leaning in toward the group,
miming grasping the table edge with one hand.  Japhet was sitting next
to Sel with eir'e liason on the other side.  E'i was straight-backed
with hands below the table, but had the barest turn to how E'i sat,
angled almost-imperceptibly away from the center of the table toward
Japhet.

Japhet sat with back hunched, eir arms crossed in front of eir chest.
E glanced up occasionally, avoiding eye contact with Trace and Jacob,
but mostly stared unfocused at the table.

Trace hadn't moved since E'd sat down next to Jacob.  E was leaning
over the table, propped up with both eir forearms on it.  E slowly
leaned farther forward, trying to rest eir head in eir left hand.  But
found emself turning eir head up, awkwardly, so as not to lose sight
of Hunt.  E was stuck there, unable to relax a step further and drop
the focus on eir attacker, unwilling to admit that the pose was
neither comfortable or comforting and move.

As Trace had settled, Japhet lifted eir gaze up and contemplated for
some time.  E turned to the shining figure next to em.  "Why, Len?
Why would you allow this to happen to someone again?  I won't believe
that you couldn't have stopped Hunt if you wanted to.  And _why_...
Why, if you were putting a murderer among us, didn't you start
introductions with the person who could _defend emself!_"

Japhet lashed out, as if to pound eir fists on the dark presence's
chest.  But they simply passed through, flailing.  Overcome and
over-balanced, E bobbed forward, eir head dipping into Len's front
before E recovered.  Sitting up, Japhet had started to cry&mdash;shiny
black specks trapped in eir tears.  "Bah!" and E kicked out, sending
the stool Len was on bouncing across the floor.

E subsided, stilling emself, the outburst gone except for eir heavy,
racking breaths.  Len had remained in place, eir'a legs and butt
swirling in the eddies from Japhet's kick.  In a moment E'a'd reformed
in a kneeling position next to Japhet, facing em.  "I did not want Fol
to be killed, or Trace attacked."  Len said, in a voice that could
have belonged to a tween girl.  "But we are bringing youse in order to
know youse, and cannot truly see you or the others unless you're free
to act.  Would you have us enact violence or revenge?  Or shall we
'understand the warp we're part of, and work our desires with the
weft'?"

Japhet opened eir mouth to object, but pulled back, chastened.  "I do
not believe that Hunt is as innocent as the storm."

"But perhaps E can be comprehended and managed, as the flood?"

"As the cancerous sheep," Japhet said, and stood.  "I want a drink."
And with that he started toward a smaller serving table, a few meters
from them toward the ship's curved outer wall.

They watched in silence as E walked over, even Sel's and Len's heads
turning.  Japhet stood next to the solid block for several moments,
then finally reached into the top to withdraw a glass, sipped, and
walked back.  E sat back down at his place with them, letting the
glass thud onto the table.  It was a simple tumbler, with almost three
fingers of a clear liquid.

"What did you get?" asked Jacob.

"I asked for _komejōchū_, uh... distilled rice."  E paused and took
another sip, closing eir eyes.  "And this could be.  It's not bad."  E
closed eir eyes again, holding the glass below eir nose.

"Would youse like anything?" asked Sel.

After a beat, Trace replied "Coffee?  Just plain hot coffee?"

"Certainly.  Jacob?"

"May I have tea?  Hot, green tea."  Eir look of hope grew with each
word.

"Yes," said Sel, "it will be just a moment."  Sel made no move from
the table or to speak further.

"Do you not drink alcohol?" asked Japhet.

"I think not around em," Trace said, jerking eir head back toward Hunt
and the other group.  "I think, perhaps, not until I return home."

"I feel less optimistic about that.  Since yesterday."  E took a gulp,
turned to face Len again.  "Since E murdered Fol.  Since you and yours
showed no concern for eir'a life, and treated eir'a body like
garbage."

Len turned from the table to Japhet.  Jacob realized with a start that
at some point Len had returned to a seated pose, eir surface extending
and expanding to give the impression of a shiny black stool below em.

"Mortality is a central aspect of humanity.  We did not wish em dead
to demonstrate this, but we will not make you abshuman to interfere
with an inevitability of your lives.  The Chaiken are long-lived, but
all mortal, and when one of them dies, E is rendered just the same."

"_Rendered_.  That's what you said yesterday."  Japhet turned back to
face Jacob and Trace, eyes wide, drink sloshing, forgotten, in eir
now-trembling hand.  "They _processed_ em, right where E'd fallen, in
front of me and everyone.  Eir body just fell apart
