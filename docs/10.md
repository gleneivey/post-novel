## Chapter 7

Trace's landing on the new floor was satisfyingly solid, the feeling
of eir feet and legs taking eir weight while the ground stayed put was
reassuring, even though E seemed noticeably heavier since they'd
arrived.  E was also relieved eir balance was steady--while they'd
been coming down, E'd felt mild waves of dizziness as they'd passed
through each floor.

E looked around.  They were in a large alcove, about six meters
square, that connected from the floor gap behind eir to a corridor
that went to the left and right.  While Jacob was still dismounting
the pad and saying something behind eir, E walked forward to look
around the corner.  The hallway was long, about four meters wide, and
curved away behind eir in both directions.  There were recessed
panels, which E guessed were doorways, every seven or eight meters
along the outer wall, with only a couple doors in the inner wall
visible.  They were all tall, almost to the ceiling, and just a bit
wider than Trace was used to.

The floor here had the same slightly-rough texture and spring as it
had everywhere they'd been in the ship so far, but here it was a light
pastel green.  The ceiling was an even lighter shade of green, with
that same uncanny not-quite-glow as the others.  It was clear the
lighting was coming evenly from the ceiling, and it was bright, but it
gave no sense that the light was actually originating from it.  As if
the hall was lit with indirect lighting bounced off the ceiling
without the original source being evident.

The walls were largely covered with patterns, in light colors, mostly
pastels with occasional vivid details.  Trace had the impression of a
series of murals, either abstracts or impressionist renderings of
things E couldn't recognize.  The doors were decorated as well, some
to blend into the surrounding image, some to complement it, and the
frames around each were unique.  The exceptions to the murals were two
sections of wall, one that was two doors to the right, the other four
doors to the left, that were completely blank.  The walls and the
doors in them were a flat and the same very light green as the
ceiling, but without the glow.

Jacob and Sel walked up to join em.  E turned back and saw that 'poor
had left them.  Sel said "The suites behind the blank walls are
youse's--youse can decorate them if youse want.  The doors will open
automatically as youse approach them, from either side.  The door,
lights, and other things in youse's rooms will respond to requests in
youse's voice only--simply talk to the room as if it were an entity
named Schön.

"Aboard ship, we keep a 24-hour day that matches Old Earth.  Abshuman
that we are aware of all adjust to it easily, and we believe that, as
natural humans, the same will be true of youse.  It is currently 37
minutes after midnight, ship's time, so youse should try to go to
sleep soon.  When youse wake tomorrow, and any time you wish really,
tell youse's room youse want to talk to me.  Once youse are both
ready, I'll collect youse, make additional introductions to people
aboard ship, and help youse with anything youse would like for youse's
rooms.

"Is there anything else I can tell you tonight?"

Trace chewed eir lip.  Jacob spoke up first:  "We've been selected to
travel with youse, right?  I'd like you tell us to where and for how
long?"

Sel nodded eir blank head, and said "We are taking youse on a tour to
meet representatives of several key abshuman clades, in order to get
them to agree that youse and youse's are wholly human and that the
society youse have maintained since being Planted in Haran is stable
and the production of future catastrophe implausible.  Depending on
how each evaluation proceeds, the tour should only take a few months.
We will be collecting additional people tomorrow, and leaving this
star system the day after."

Trace felt like this explanation was far more likely to keep em awake
than the unknown had been, but what's known is known.  Eir own
question seemed more pressing than trying to find out more about their
tour.  "What and when do we eat and drink?"

"Ah, yes," said Sel.  "Youse's rooms have devices that can produce
food and drink on request, and areas for eating.  The rooms' controls
should be able to explain to you equivalencies between things you
request and what is available.  There will also be occasions when
groups of people eat together."

"Thank you."

"You are most welcome, Trace.  I hope that you are comfortable and
have a pleasant night.  Do not hesitate to contact me--I do not
sleep."  With that, Sel gave a small bow from eir waist, turned and
walked away from them, back to the gap in the floor, and then out into
thin-air beyond it.

Jacob turned to em.  "I'm glad you're here.  I hope we'll get to know
each other, but even though we don't yet, really, this would all have
been much harder to go through if I were truly alone with them."

"Thank you, I agree.  It's nice to have at least one person around
that I'm pretty confident I'll understand what they're saying.  Even
Sel...."  Trace shook eir head.  "Do you know what an 'abshuman' or a
'clade' is?"

"I think 'clade' is some kind of group, in biology.  I did a bunch of
illustrations of different kinds of spikez for a professor at the
university.  'Clade' was the last word in the title of each."

"Huh.  Well, thank you.  And good night.  Which room do you want?"

"They're supposed to be the same, right?"  Jacob said.  "I guess
which ever one lets me in...."  E walked around the corner to their
right, heading for the closer of the unmarked doors.  It slid to the
side into the wall as E got close.  "So, this is me then.  Sleep
well."  E waved at Trace and stepped inside.  The door closed behind
em, leaving Trace alone in the hall.

Trace turned left corner and walked down the hall, almost thirty
meters before E reached the first undecorated door.  It slid open
silently as E reached it, and E stepped inside.  The floor and wall
colors matched the hallway outside.  The room was almost eight meters
wide, and about six between the door and the wall opposite, which
contained three windows that matched those that had been at each of
landings in the ramps they'd used--almost two meters square each.  It
was spartan, the unembellished furniture within designed with straight
lines and simple curves.

There was a partition a few meters to the left, obscuring eir view of
a corner of the room, and a wall just to eir right that had a charging
shelf and a number of coat pegs sticking out of it.  E let out a
single barking laugh; caught it before it could turn into a flow of
ironic cackling.  The juxtaposition of something so incredibly
familiar and mundane with the rest of the surroundings, knowing that
these details had almost certainly been added just for em, was
overwhelming.  E took the phone out of eir sporran, noted that it
turned on, was still keeping time, and unsurprisingly, couldn't
connect to anything.  Obligingly, E put it on the charging shelf.
Continuing the ritual, E dropped eir duffel, unclipped and hung eir
sword, then the belt and sporran, and finally the top of eir gi.  E
kicked of eir boots and left them under the pegs.

E picked up the duffel and carried it a few meters farther into the
room, and set it on a couch that was arranged with a few other chairs
around a low round table.  Like the ones on the small ship, what would
have been the back and arms of the couch rose only about ten
centimeters above the level of the cushions.

There was furniture all along the wall of windows.  Diagonally
opposite the door was a bed, larger than E was used to for a single--a
couple of meters wide and not quite three long.  In the opposite
corner, a taller table surrounded by six chairs with the same
very-narrow back E'd seen on the ship from Haran.  And in between was
a classic bar with four stools.

Turning around, E saw that the area blocked from view of the door
contained a bathroom.  There were a set of narrow closets or cabinets
sticking into the room from the wall opposite the partition, and
connecting the end of the partition to about the middle of the row of
cabinets was a wall of floor-to-ceiling glass panels, that appeared to
be able to telescope into a gap between cabinet segments.  Inside the
glass area were an incredibly-normal looking vanity, toilet, and
tub/shower.  There seemed to be no provision for a curtain or
enclosure around the shower.

Not knowing what else to do next, Trace stood in the middle of the
room and stripped.  E put eir gi pants across the end of the duffel
and left everything else in a pile on the floor.  _Tomorrow I'll ask
about laundry_.  E bent over, unzipped eir duffel, took out one of the
canteens, and took a drink.

E was torn between trying the shower or the bed.  Decided on the bed.

E didn't see any seems to distinguish linens from what might have been
the bed itself, but decided that figuring out how to make or clean it
wasn't eir problem at the moment.  The bed had one anemic-looking
pillow and single cover, and everything was a light cream color.  The
surface of the mattress, pillow, and the inside of the thin blanket
were all the same texture, which was simultaneously very smooth and
not at all slippery.  The outer surface of the blanket was lightly
textured, like the weave of eir thermals but at a tenth the scale.  E
slid under the cover, put eir head on the pillow, and was very
uncomfortable.

Trace didn't want to strike up a conversation with eir room, and had
been considering sleeping with the lights still on in order to avoid
it.  But E wanted both more blankets and more pillows.  So, E stifled
eir discomfort, and addressed the air "Schön, are you there?"

"You may make requests."

"Schön, I would like to have a couple more pillows and a thicker
blanket."

"Both of these can be provided, but your existing ones can also be
adjusted.  Are you implying that your pillow is currently not thick
enough or not firm enough?"

"Yes, exactly.  I'd like one at least twice as thick and firmer.  Do
you have one like that?"

"Yours is like that."  Before Trace could ask what that statement
meant, the pillow under eir began to swell, as if it were inhaling.
But it didn't expand like a balloon--there was clearly a solid texture
or substance within it, and somehow that became firmer at the same
time.  "Is that sufficient?" asked eir room's voice.

"That is much better, thank you.  Can you make it even a little more
firm?"

"It can be more firm.  Assuming you meant that as a request, firming
now."  And the pillow did become just a little bit stiffer.  "You also
asked for a thicker blanket.  Assuming you meant you wished for it to
retain more heat, adjusting now.  It will be a few minutes until your
temperature stabilizes.  Request additional adjustment at that time if
desired."

"Schön, I'd like you to wake me in ten hours if I'm not already."

"Yes."

"And Schön, please turn out the lights."  The room became dark, with
no other reply.

Trace rolled to face out the window eir bed was next to, and after
about ten minutes of watching the stars stream across from bottom to
top, E was asleep.

*****

It had taken Jacob a couple of hours to get settled and to sleep,
repeatedly getting in bed, not falling asleep, and then puttering
around eir suit.  E had eir clothing and things tucked away, had
repeatedly adjusted the bed, had bathed, had learned that when you ask
Schön for food, it comes out of a compartment in the wall next to the
dining table.  E'd also learned that you couldn't really make
conversation with Schön.

E'd slept for maybe five hours, then found emself awake and feeling
too anxious to get back to sleep.  That had been an hour before, but E
still hadn't felt ready to call Sel and admit the day was going to
start.  E was sitting in one of the chairs from the dining table that
E'd pulled back into the room, facing the windows, and idly bouncing a
ball against the window and floor.  Mas[[@]] had insisted that Jacob
take the ball with em, and now it seemed to be eir most comforting
possession.  Normally E could settle emself by drawing, but even that
seemed too overwhelming to em.

Sel had said "months," which had the virtue of not being "forever" or
"just a week but then the ship explodes."  But everything else E'd
said left Jacob uneasy.  E'a had the sense that they were more cargo
than guests.  E'a and Trace were along not because they'd won
something or the Chaiken expected to enjoy their company, but they
were somehow the best choice for show-and-tell.
